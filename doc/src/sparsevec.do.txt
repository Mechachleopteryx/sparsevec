__Summary.__ This document applies one specific
example to illustrate the following different programming styles:
flat program, function-based program, module-based program,
class-based program, and object-oriented, class-based program.


===== Project: Alternative software solutions for sparse data =====

Many big data collections are *sparse*, meaning that a large portion
of the data consists of zeros. In such cases, it is important to avoid
storing the zeros. The purpose of this exercise is to compress a big
data structure by storing the non-zeros only and adding information
where the non-zeros appear in the original big data stream.
Functionality for looking up an element (zero or non-zero) in the
original stream must also be included.

We assume that the data are available as a series of numbers in a
(potentially huge) file. The numbers are to be read one by one and
stored in a compressed data structure. We look at two alternative
compressed data structures: a sparse vector and a hash.

=== Sparse vector ===

One can store all the non-zeroes consecutively in a vector
(one-dimensional array) `data` and use another integer list/array
`index` for the corresponding index in the original stream of
numbers. For instance, `data[i]` holds the value of the number with
position `index[i]` in the original stream.  As a specific example,
consider the stream of numbers

!bc
0  1.1  3  0  0  0  5.1  -2  0  0  4  0  2  0  0  1  0
!ec
The data structure, referred to as a *sparse vector*, consists of the
`data` list/array with elements

!bc
1.1  3  5.1  -2  4  2  1
!ec
and `index` with elements

!bc
1 2 6 7 10 12 15
!ec
Note that we index the elements in the original stream from 0.
Also note that the `data` list/array must have numbers (not strings)
that we can compute with.

=== Hash ===

A simpler data structure is to store the non-zeros in a hash
(also called associative array or dictionary) with the original
position in the stream as key and the non-zero number as value.
For the stream of numbers above we get in Python the dictionary

!bc pycod
data_hash = {1: 1.1, 2: 3, 6: 5.1, 7: -2, 10: 4, 12: 2, 15: 1}
!ec

__Flat program.__
Place the sample stream of numbers listed above in a file with
multiple lines. Make a program that reads the numbers one by one from
the file and creates the sparse vector representation and the
hash. Open two new files and store the sparse vector and the hash,
respectively.  Write out the value of the numbers with indices 10 and
11 in the original stream.  Make a ``flat program'' without any use of
functions.

file=sv_func

__Function-based code.__

 * Write a function `sparsevec(filename, outname=None)`
   for reading a stream ofnumbers in a file with name `filename`
   and returning a sparse vector representation. If the argument
   `outname` is not `None`, the computed compressed data structure
   is also dumped to the file with name `outname`.
 * Write a similar function `hash(filename, outfile=None)` for
   returning the hash representation of the data stream.
 * Write two functions `sparsevec_index(i, data, index)` and
   `hash_index(i, data_hash)` that return the value of the number with
   position `i` in the original stream.
 * Use the functions to solve the same problem as under *Flat program*.
 * Make sure the program file can be reused later in other source code files.

!bremarks
Finding the relation between the index in the original stream and
the index in the sparse vector requires a search procedure which
can be tedius. It is advantageous to add an inverse index mapping
`inv_index` as an integer array with the property that
`inv_index[index[i]] == i`.
% if CODE == 'python':
In Python, however, this functionality
is present in list objects by the `index` method (if you use
an integer NumPy array for the indices, you can use a list
version of the array, obtained by the `tostring()` method, for
index loop-up).

__Smarter index function.__
Collect the arrays in the sparse vector representation in a hash or
list such that the data structure is a single variable.  Then make a
single `index(i, data)` function that can accept either a sparse
vector or a hash as data structure, `data`, and return the value of
the number in position `i` in the original data stream. Test that
the new `index` function gives the same results as the alternative
versions `sparsevec_index` and `hash_index`.

${solution_file('sv_index')}

!bnotice Comment
Note the use of `i`, not `index`, as variable for storing the returned
index array `sparsevec`. Use of `index` as variable name would hide
the name of the new `index` function we wrote. Similarly,
the data list returned from `sparsevec` is called `d` to avoid
confusion with the name `data`, which is here used for the collection
of `d` and `i` in a dictionary (hash).

file=sparsebigdata

__Module-based code.__
Put the four functions created under *Function-based code* in a
Python module called `sparsebigdata` with the functionality
that it is not necessary to
supply the compressed data structure every time we want to
look up data given an index. More precisely, a user can
do the following

!bc pycod
from sparsebigdata import index, load, save

# Work with sparse vector representation
load('mybigdatafile.dat', data_structure='sparsevec')
print index(10), index(11)

# Work with hash
load('mybigdatafile.dat', data_structure='hash')
print index(10), index(11)
!ec
Try to reuse as much as possible from previously made and tested code.

!bhint Hint
Let the sparse data structure `data` as introduced
in c) be a global variable in the module.

__Class-based code.__
Make a class such that we can work with compressed sparse data
in the following way:

% if CODE == 'python':
!bc pycod
from sv_class import SparseBigData

data = SparseBigData('mybigdatafile.dat', data_structure='sparsevec')
# Look up original numbers no 10 and 11
print data[10], data[11]
# Print underlying data structure
print data.sparsevec  # array of non-zeros
print data.index      # array of original indices

data = SparseBigData('mybigdatafile.dat', data_structure='hash')
# Look up original numbers no 10 and 11
print data[10], data[11]
# Print underlying data structure
print data.hash
!ec
% elif CODE == 'java':
% endif

!bsubex
__OO-based code.__
Introduce a superclass `SparseBigData` and implement the functionality
based on a sparse vector in a subclass `SparseVec` and the hash-based
functionality in a subclass `Hash`.  Place as much code as possible
in the superclass to be reused by subclasses.
Rewrite the demo program above for the new class structure.
